							<!-- <p>Electoral systems translate the choices voters make in a general election into seats won by candidates and parties. In the process of this translation, rules influence candidates’ actions during campaigns, voters’ calculus when making a vote choice, and representatives’ decisions about how to spend their time in office, and in so doing, they create incentives for strategic behavior on the part of voters, (pre-)candidates, party elites, and elected representatives, including legislators and their chamber leaders.   All electoral systems share a common set of component rules. Each rule can take on a number of different values. When combining the values taken by these rules into a system, the number of possible combinations is quite large, which means that specific systems have the potential to provide precise, targeted incentives that govern relationships between political parties --- interparty politics --- and within parties --- intraparty politics.</p> -->
